  <span>Hay Bales. I love hay bales. Took this snap on a drive
  through the countryside past some straw fields</span>


  <span>Lake. The lake was so calm today. We had a great view
  of the snow on the mountains from here.</span>

  <span>Canyon. I hiked to the top of the mountain and got
  this picture of the canyon and trees below.</span>

  <span>Iceberg. It was amazing to see an iceberg up close,
  it was so cold but didnâ€™t snow today.</span>

  <span>Desert. The red cliffs were beautiful. It was really
  hot in the desert but we did a lot of walking through the canyons.</span>

  <span>Fall. Fall is coming, I love when the leaves on the
  trees start to change color.</span>

  <span>Plantation. I drove past this plantation yesterday,
  everything is so green!</span>

  <span>Dunes. My summer vacation to the Oregon Coast. I love
  the sandy dunes!</span>

  <span>Countryside Lane. We enjoyed a quiet stroll down this
  countryside lane</span>

  <span>Sunset. Sunset at the coast! The sky turned a lovely
  shade of orange.</span>

  <span>Cave. I did a tour of a cave today and the view of
  the landscape below was breathtaking.</span>

  <span>Bluebells. I walked through this meadow of bluebells and
  got a good view of the snow on the mountain before the fog came in.</span>
